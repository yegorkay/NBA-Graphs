# NBA-Graphs

A tool to visualize the distribution of points by an NBA player in a given season.

* Open your command line and run `npm install`
* After installation is complete, run `gulp watch`
* In the early iterations of the application, in order to change the data of the graph, open `test.js` and edit the URL to match the player of your choosing using a gamelog of the player of your choosing from [Basketball Reference](https://basketball-reference.com)
* Once you have updated the URL, run `node test.js` to update `data.json`
